They may register again for the courses, when they are offered in the next academic year. However, there is also a provision to run summer courses in failed courses for these students who may register and attend the course and write the final examination. This provision is only for students who have got 45% or more in the internal evaluation for the courses they attended in the regular semester.  Students should have 75% attendance in the summer course to write the examination.

          \n    For higher semesters,i.e., fifth semester onwards, summer courses are not offered.  Failed students who have less than 45% marks in internal assessments have to register again for the course in the regular semester in which it is offered and complete the course as per the regulations and appear for the end semester examination. Failed students having 45% marks or more in internal assessments have the option to register again for the course as mentioned above or register only for the end semester examination without attending the course again. A separate registration format will be available for this. This option is available in all semesters.
        \n
        \n
        k)  <b> Contact Courses</b>
        \n

Students who have missed either the first or the second test can register with the consent of the faculty and the Head of the Department (HOD) concerned for a retest which shall be conducted soon after the completion of the second test, but before the end semester examination. The re-test will cover both first and second test course plans. Those who have missed both the tests are not eligible to appear for the end semester examination. However if one misses both tests due to medical reasons or other personal exigencies, based on genuine evidence, a single test of 2 hour duration for 40 marks will be conducted covering the whole syllabus, before the end semester examinations. Decision on this will be taken by the Principal and verified by the external academic auditor.

        \n
        \n

On completion of these, grades will be assigned. In case the Practical /Laboratory/Workshop courses are not completed in the semester, grade I (incomplete) will be awarded against the course and the final grade will be given only after the completion of the course/assessments.

              \n
        \n
        c)     Comprehensive Examination
